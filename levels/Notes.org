* What i see
- 4 interfaces A1 to D1
- 4 clients A to D
- Every interface has a IPaddress
  - A1, B1: start with 104
  - C1, D1: start with 211
  - then they are different
- They all have a Mask
- connections exist between:
  - A and B
  - C and D

* Routing
** Explanation how routers work: If i have the division into four subnets. How does a router determine the right subnet?

Here's a step-by-step process:

1. *Subnet Mask:* The subnet mask defines the size of each subnet and distinguishes the network bits from the host bits.
   - Example with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192 (/26).

2. *IP Address:* Let's say you have an IP address of 192.168.1.34.

3. *Subnet Calculation:*
   - Convert the IP address and subnet mask to binary.
     - 192.168.1.34 -> 11000000.10101000.00000001.00100010
     - 255.255.255.192 -> 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000

4. *Network Part:* Perform a bitwise AND operation on the IP address and subnet mask to identify the network.
   - IP address (binary) & Subnet mask (binary)
   - 11000000.10101000.00000001.00100010 & 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000
   - Resulting network part: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000 (192.168.1.0/26)

5. *Router Decision:* The router uses the calculated network part to match with its routing table entries to determine the correct subnet and forward the packet to the appropriate destination within that subnet.

In this example, 192.168.1.34 belongs to the subnet 192.168.1.0/26 (specific subnet within an Iv4 network), and the router directs the traffic accordingly.
- 192.168.1.0/26
  - 192.168.1.0 is starting IP address of the subnet
  - /26 specifies that th efirst 26 bits of the address are used for the network prefix

  - The "/26" in "192.168.1.0/26" specifies how the IP address is divided into the network and host portions. It informs devices and network administrators how the subnet is structured.
  - *Network Portion*: The "/26" signifies that the first 26 bits out of the 32 bits in the IP address represent the network portion.
  - *Host Portion*: The remaining bits (32 - 26 = 6 bits) represent the host portion, which allows for individual device addresses within the subnet.
  - The primary reason for mentioning "/26" is to clarify how the network is subnetted. It helps devices determine:
    1. *Network Boundary*: What addresses belong to the network.
    2. *Subnetwork Size*: The number of possible hosts. For a /26 subnet, there are 64 addresses (2^6), but only 62 are usable for devices because one is reserved for the network address and another for the broadcast address.
    3. *Routing*: How data should be routed to destinations within and outside the subnet.

- */26*: This alone refers to the subnet mask length without specifying a particular network address. It tells you that the first 26 bits of any given IP are used for the network part, leaving 6 bits for the host part.

** what is a subnet mask. Explain to a newby, use bullet points
- *Subnet Mask Purpose:* Helps differentiate the network part of an IP address from the host part.
- *Format:* Written like an IP address, e.g., 255.255.255.0.
- *Function:*
  - *255:* Indicates that the corresponding part of the IP address belongs to the network.
  - *0:* Indicates that the corresponding part of the IP address identifies the host within that network.
- *Example:*
  - *IP Address:* 192.168.1.10
  - *Subnet Mask:* 255.255.255.0
  - *Meaning:* 192.168.1 is the network part, and 10 is the host part.
- *Analogy:* Think of a street address where the street name is the network and the house number is the host.


** Examples

Sure, here are some examples:

1. *Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192*
   - IP Range: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.63
   - Meaning: Divides into four subnets with 62 hosts each.

2. *Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.224*
   - IP Range: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.31
   - Meaning: Divides into eight subnets with 30 hosts each.

3. *Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240*
   - IP Range: 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.15
   - Meaning: Divides into sixteen subnets with 14 hosts each.

In each case, the network has fewer hosts but more subnets.
