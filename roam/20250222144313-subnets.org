- logically segmented portion of a larger network (like a neighborhood)
* Subnetting
- Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller, more manageable sections
** Purpose
- *Efficient IP Address Use*:
  - Subnetting allows for better utilization of IP addresses, preventing waste and allowing for more devices within networks
- *Improved Network Performance*:
  - By limiting broadcast domains, it reduces network congestion and improves overall performance
- *Enhanced Security*:
  - Subnets can isolate different network segments, adding a layer of security by controlling traffic flow between them
- *Simplified Management*:
  - Smaller, segmented networks are easier to manage and troubleshoot

** How Subnetting is done
1. *Determine Requirements*:
   - Identify how many subnets are needed and how many devices (hosts) each subnet must support
2. *Choose a Subnet Mask*:
   - A subnet mask determines how an IP address is split into network and host portions
   - Adjust the subnet mask to create the number of needed subnets while accommodating required hosts
3. *Calculate Subnets*:
   - In IPv4, use the subnet mask to break down the address
     - For example, changing the mask from /24 (255.255.255.0) to /26 (255.255.255.192) creates four subnets
     - The number of subnets can be calculated as 2^(number of new bits allocated for subnetting)
4. *Assign Subnet Addresses*:
   - Allocate subnet addresses within the available IP range
   - Each subnet will have a range of IP addresses it can use
5. *Plan for Broadcast and Network Addresses*:
   - Each subnet needs one address for the network identifier and one for the broadcast address, which reduces usable host addresses by 2.
6. *Verify and Deploy*:
   - Check your calculations to ensure they fit within the original network size, then assign addresses to devices within the subnets.
