Broadcast and network addresses serve specific purposes within a subnet:

1. *Network Address*:
   - The network address identifies a specific subnet within a larger network.
   - It is derived by setting all the host bits in the address to zero.
   - It represents the starting address of a subnet and cannot be assigned to any device.
   - Example: In the subnet 192.168.1.0/24, the network address is 192.168.1.0.

2. *Broadcast Address*:
   - The broadcast address is used to send data to all devices within a subnet.
   - It is derived by setting all the host bits in the address to one.
   - Network devices use this address to communicate with all hosts in the subnet simultaneously.
   - Example: In the subnet 192.168.1.0/24, the broadcast address is 192.168.1.255.

Both network and broadcast addresses help in managing and directing network traffic efficiently, ensuring that data is sent to the right destinations within a subnet.
