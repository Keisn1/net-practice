Broadcast and network addresses serve specific purposes within a subnet:

1. *Network Address*: (all host bits to zero)
   - The network address identifies a specific subnet within a larger network.
   - It is derived by setting all the host bits in the address to zero.
   - It represents the starting address of a subnet and cannot be assigned to any device.
   - Example: In the subnet 192.168.1.0/27, the network address is 192.168.1.0.
     - IP address:
       - 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
       - 11111111 11111111 11111111 00100000
       - 11111111 11111111 11111111 01000000
       - 11111111 11111111 11111111 01100000
       - ...
       - 11111111 11111111 11111111 11100000

2. *Broadcast Address*: (all the host bits to 1)
   - The broadcast address is used to send data to all devices within a subnet.
   - It is derived by setting all the host bits in the address to one.
   - Network devices use this address to communicate with all hosts in the subnet simultaneously.
   - Example: In the subnet 192.168.1.0/24, the broadcast address is 192.168.1.255.

Both network and broadcast addresses help in managing and directing network traffic efficiently, ensuring that data is sent to the right destinations within a subnet.
