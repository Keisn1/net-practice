#+startup: overview

- Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller, more manageable sections
- done via [[id:aeebc00e-c1e6-499a-a7bf-b910d3bdf78a][Subnet Masks (CIDR notation)]]

* How subnetting works
- The network part of the IP address identifies the overall network.
- When data is sent from one device to another, network equipment use this part to quickly determine the general destination network
  - Think of it like sorting mail by city before narrowing it down to individual street addresses
- The host part of the IP address identifies the specific device within that network
  - Once the data reaches the correct network, the host part is used to direct the data to the exact device intended, similar to how a postal worker delivers mail to the correct house on a street
** Division into subnets
- An IP address consists of four octets (for IPv4) xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
- given a "\ n" subnet where n > 24, 32 - n addresses for the host part
  - 2*(n - 24) subnets
    - each time that the last octect of IPv4 address has a bit set, where the bit is set in the mask, the Network part is changing
    - there are 2*(n-24) different combinations of set bits in the last octet, that intersects with the set bits in the network mask

*** example \24
- one network 0-255 for the host part
- A /24 subnet mask does not divide a network into smaller subnets; instead, it defines a single subnet by itself
- With a /24 subnet mask, there are 24 bits used for the network portion and 8 bits for the host portion
- This setup typically provides one subnet with 256 IP addresses, of which 254 are usable for hosts (after accounting for the network and broadcast addresses).
- To divide a network into multiple subnets, you would normally use a subnet mask longer than /24 (e.g., /25, /26, etc.) to allocate additional bits to the network portion. However, with just a /24 mask, the network is simply treated as a single subnet.
** Expanding networks
* Purpose
- *Efficient IP Address Use*:
  - Subnetting allows for better utilization of IP addresses, preventing waste and allowing for more devices within networks
- *Improved Network Performance*:
  - By limiting broadcast domains, it reduces network congestion and improves overall performance
- *Enhanced Security*:
  - Subnets can isolate different network segments, adding a layer of security by controlling traffic flow between them
- *Simplified Management*:
  - Smaller, segmented networks are easier to manage and troubleshoot

* How Subnetting is done
1. *Determine Requirements*:
   - Identify how many subnets are needed and how many devices (hosts) each subnet must support
2. *Choose a Subnet Mask*:
   - A subnet mask determines how an IP address is split into network and host portions
   - Adjust the subnet mask to create the number of needed subnets while accommodating required hosts
3. *Calculate Subnets*:
   - In IPv4, use the subnet mask to break down the address
     - For example, changing the mask from /24 (255.255.255.0) to /26 (255.255.255.192) creates four subnets
     - The number of subnets can be calculated as 2^(number of new bits allocated for subnetting)
4. *Assign Subnet Addresses*:
   - Allocate subnet addresses within the available IP range
   - Each subnet will have a range of IP addresses it can use
5. *Plan for Broadcast and Network Addresses*:
   - Each subnet needs one address for the network identifier and one for the broadcast address, which reduces usable host addresses by 2.
6. *Verify and Deploy*:
   - Check your calculations to ensure they fit within the original network size, then assign addresses to devices within the subnets.
