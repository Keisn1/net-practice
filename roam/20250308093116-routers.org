"Routing"
- determine which path packets should take to reach their destination

- A router is a network device that forwards data packets between different networks
- It operates primarily at *Layer 3 of the OSI model*, which is the Network Layer
- a Router connects different networks
  - it is important that the different networks (subnets) don't overlap
* Characteristics
** Routing Data Between Networks
- Routers determine the best path for data to travel from one network to another
- Using routing tables and protocols, a router decides how to forward packets to their destination, effectively connecting different subnets or networks
** Network Layer Operations
- Working at the Network Layer, routers make forwarding decisions based on IP addresses rather than MAC addresses
- enables them to connect different IP networks and direct traffic based on network topologies

** Maintaining Routing Tables
- Routers maintain routing tables that store information about network paths.
- These tables are updated dynamically through routing protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

** Multiple Interfaces
- Routers typically have multiple interfaces because each interface connects to a different network.
  - For instance, a typical home router might have one interface connected to the internet (WAN) and multiple interfaces for local network connections (LAN)
- Each interface can belong to a different IP subnet, allowing the router to route traffic between these subnets
- This is essential for providing connectivity between various network segments and managing traffic efficiently

** Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Routers often perform NAT, which allows multiple devices on a local network to access the internet using a single public IP address.
- This is commonly used in home and small business networks.

** Traffic Management and Security
- Routers can also perform traffic management functions, such as filtering traffic with access control lists (ACLs) and implementing quality of service (QoS) policies to prioritize certain types of traffic.
- They often include firewalls for enhancing network security by blocking unauthorized access and monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic.
